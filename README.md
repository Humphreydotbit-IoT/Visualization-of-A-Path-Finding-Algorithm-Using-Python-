# Visualization of A* Path Finding Algorithm Using Python

## Overview

This project visualizes the A* Path Finding Algorithm using the Pygame library. The A* algorithm is an efficient pathfinding algorithm that is commonly used in various applications such as game development, robotics, and AI for finding the shortest path between two points on a grid.

## Basic Concepts

Graphs are data structures used to represent connections between pairs of elements. These elements are called nodes, which represent real-life objects, persons, or entities. The connections between nodes are called edges.

### Applications

Graphs are directly applicable to real-world scenarios, such as:

- **Routing**: Nodes represent important places (junctions, cities), while edges correspond to roads connecting these places.
- **Communication Networks**: Nodes are phones, modems, servers, ISPs, and more, while edges are data lines connecting them.
- **Gantt Diagrams for Sequence Planning**: Nodes correspond to phases of the projects, and directed edges to dependencies between sections.
- **Representation of Hierarchical Structures**: Nodes could correspond to people or departments, and edges visualize a hierarchy of command.

### Types of Graphs

- **Undirected Graphs**: You can go from one node to the other in both directions.
- **Directed Graphs**: You can only go from one node to another in a specific direction, represented by arrows.
- **Weighted Graphs**: Edges have a weight or cost, representing distance, time, or other measures.

### Common Algorithms for Shortest Paths

- **A* Algorithm**
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**

### A* Algorithm

A* is a relatively simple adjustment to Dijkstra’s algorithm, making it a Best-First Search instead. It uses two scoring mechanisms for each node: the cost to reach the node and a heuristic score for how close a node is to the target node.

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of A* depends on the quality of the heuristic function. In a worst-case scenario, it can be O(b^d) where b is the branching factor, and d is the number of nodes on the resulting path.
